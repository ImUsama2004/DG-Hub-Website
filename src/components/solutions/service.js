        description: `Virtual Server and Backup Infrastructure solutions are two critical components of modern IT systems.

                    Virtual Server solutions allow organizations to create multiple virtual servers on a single physical server, allowing for more efficient use of hardware resources and increased flexibility in deploying applications and services. This technology allows organizations to rapidly provision new servers, adjust resources to meet changing demand, and scale up or down as needed.  Switch Technologies has partnered with VMWare to provide seamless virtualization solutions that scale to any size environment.

                    Backup Infrastructure solutions, on the other hand, are designed to ensure that critical data and applications are protected from loss or corruption. This includes regular backups, redundant storage systems, and disaster recovery plans. With the right backup infrastructure in place, organizations can quickly recover from any unexpected data loss or system failures, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.

                    Together, Virtual Server and Backup Infrastructure solutions provide a strong foundation for modern IT systems, enabling organizations to maximize efficiency, agility, and resilience.`

                    `Campus networks are increasingly complex, supporting a wide variety of business critical wired/wireless services. Managers can no longer afford to simply react to problems, but must position themselves to foresee performance issues by continuously monitoring critical systems.

                    Traditional network management systems (NMS) provide a mechanism to scrutinize network operation in great detail. However, these systems are difficult to implement and costly to maintain. The high overhead associated with commercial NMS systems has discouraged many managers from utilizing these solutions – leaving them with no tools to anticipate and trouble-shoot service issues. 

                    Switch Technologies addresses this with its Simple Network Monitoring System (SNMS).

                    SNMS is an authenticated-access, on-site monitoring server administered via easy to understand web pages. Integration into a network can literally take minutes and continued management is equally convenient.

                    SNMS contains tools to monitor network switches, wireless controllers, servers, VOIP  systems and to alert when failures are detected. The system also contains a wide variety of tools to help trouble-shoot and repair failed services. SNMS maintains persistent device log files and SNMP traps as additional aids for problem-solving.`
